## AP Project

Project Description
----
This is a replica of the game **Tank Stars** designed in Java using LibGDX. It features a single-player and a multiplayer game mode, has support for saving and resuming games and has a simple and intuitive user interface that allows the user to learn on the way as they use it.  

It also features close-to-real-life physics that tries to accurately simulate the movement of tanks and trajectory of projectiles through space.  

Repository Description
----
[Project](https://github.com/latentghost/AP_Project/tree/main/Project) folder contains all the relevant code files. Run [Main.java](https://github.com/latentghost/AP_Project/blob/main/Project/core/src/com/tankstars/Main.java) to start the game.  
[Project/assets/](https://github.com/latentghost/AP_Project/tree/main/Project/assets) folder contains all the images and vectors used to build the visuals.
Ignore Gradle build files.  

[Non-Project](https://github.com/latentghost/AP_Project/tree/main/Non_Project) folder shows the UML diagrams for the workflow of the game.  
It also has a [gameplay recording](https://github.com/latentghost/AP_Project/blob/main/Non_Project/game_recording.mov.zip) that walks through how to play the game after running [Main.java](https://github.com/latentghost/AP_Project/blob/main/Project/core/src/com/tankstars/Main.java).
